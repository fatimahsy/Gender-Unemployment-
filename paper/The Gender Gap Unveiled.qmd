abstract: "This paper examines the impact of gender on unemployment rates across various demographics from 2018 to 2023, employing a comprehensive dataset from the Labor Force Survey to unravel the interplay between gender and overall economic participation.We also imploy the use of a linear regression model to help disect the influence of gender, among other predictors, on the unemployment rates of Generatinon Z. Our findings reveal significant disparities in unemployment trends, with distinct patterns emerging between different genders and age groups, hilighting the persistent gender gap in the labour market. This reaserch is important because t sheds light on the underlying factors that contribute to unemployment disparities, offering insights into the effectiveness of current policies and the need for targeted interventions.Ultimately, this paper enhances our understanding of the labour market's complexities, advocating for inclusinve economic strategies to bridge the gender divide in employment opportunities.

## Model Set-up 

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Gen Z Unemployment} = \beta_0 &+ \beta_1 \cdot \text{Sex} \\
&+ \beta_2 \cdot \text{Reference Period} \\
&+ \beta_3 \cdot \text{Adult Unemployment} \\
&+ \beta_4 \cdot \text{Seniors Unemployment} + \epsilon
\end{aligned}
$$


Where:

- `Gen z Unemployment` is
- `Sex` is 
- `Reference Period` is another independent variable that represents the time frame of the data collection (e.g., year).
- `Adult Unemployment` and `Seniors Unemployment` are independent variables 
- $\beta_0$ is the y-intercept, representing the expected value of `Gen z Unemployment` when all the independent variables are 0.
- $\beta_1, \beta_2, \beta_3, \beta_4$ are the coefficients for each independent variable, representing the change in `Gen z Unemployment` for a one-unit change in the respective independent variable, holding all other variables constant.
- $\epsilon$ represents the error term, accounting for the variability in `Gen z Unemployment` not explained by the model.
