Can you help me come up with testcases for the given simulated data i have created using the following code: # Define the parameters used
years <- 2018:2023
age_groups <- c("15-24", "25-44", "45 and over")
sexes <- c("both sexes", "male", "female")

# Create simulated data
dataf <- expand.grid(Year=years, Sex=sexes, AgeGroup=age_groups)
dataf$UnemploymentRate <- NA # Initialize the unemployment rates column

# simulate unemployment rates
simulate_unemployment <- function(base_rate, years, fluctuation_range) {
  sapply(1:length(years), function(x) base_rate + sample(fluctuation_range, 1))
}

for(sex in sexes) {
  for(age_group in age_groups) {
    base_rate <- sample(5:25, 1)
    dataf$UnemploymentRate[dataf$Sex == sex & dataf$AgeGroup == age_group] <-
      simulate_unemployment(base_rate, years, -3:3)
  }
}

# Table rearrangements for visuals 
dataf <- reshape(dataf, idvar = c("Sex", "Year"), timevar = "AgeGroup", direction = "wide")

names(dataf)[3:5] <- age_groups

Creating test cases for a data frame involves considering scenarios where the data frame might be used and validating if it meets the requirements or handles exceptions appropriately. Here's a set of hypothetical test cases that you might consider for the unemployment rates data frame, typically to be checked through assertions or conditional checks in R:

Test Case: Validate DataFrame Structure
Description: Ensure the data frame has the correct structure with the expected columns.
Test Steps:
Check if the data frame has columns 'Sex', 'Year', and the specified age groups.
Expected Result: Data frame contains exactly these columns: 'Sex', 'Year', '15-24', '25-44', '45 and over'.
Test Case: Validate Data Types
Description: Validate that each column contains data of the correct type.
Test Steps:
Check the data type of each column (factor/string for 'Sex', integer for 'Year', numeric for unemployment rates).
Expected Result: Each column should have data of the type: 'Sex' (factor/string), 'Year' (integer), unemployment rates (numeric).
Test Case: Check for Missing Values
Description: The data frame should not have any missing values.
Test Steps:
Check each cell in the data frame for NA values.
Expected Result: There should be no NA values in the data frame.
Test Case: Validate Year Range
Description: All years should fall within the specified range (2018-2023).
Test Steps:
Check the 'Year' column for any values outside the 2018-2023 range.
Expected Result: All values in 'Year' should be within 2018 to 2023 inclusive.
Test Case: Validate Unemployment Rate Range
Description: Unemployment rates should be within a plausible range (e.g., 0-100%).
Test Steps:
Check that all unemployment rate values are between 0 and 100.
Expected Result: Unemployment rates should all be within the range 0 to 100.
Test Case: Check for Duplicates
Description: There should be no duplicate rows in the data frame.
Test Steps:
Check for any duplicate rows.
Expected Result: No duplicate rows should be present.
Test Case: Validate Sex Categories
Description: The 'Sex' column should only contain the categories 'both sexes', 'male', 'female'.
Test Steps:
Check the 'Sex' column for any values outside the specified categories.
Expected Result: All entries in 'Sex' should be one of 'both sexes', 'male', 'female'.
Test Case: Cross-Group Consistency
Description: Ensure the unemployment rates for 'both sexes' is a logical average of the 'male' and 'female' rates.
Test Steps:
For each year and age group, calculate the average of 'male' and 'female' rates and compare it with the 'both sexes' rate.
Expected Result: The 'both sexes' rate should closely match the average of the 'male' and 'female' rates.
Test Case: Yearly Continuity
Description: Check for large fluctuations in unemployment rates from year to year which may indicate data entry errors.
Test Steps:
For each sex and age group, check for year-over-year changes that exceed a certain threshold (e.g., 20%).
Expected Result: Year-over-year changes should be within the expected threshold.
Test Case: Aggregate Statistics
Description: Validate the summary statistics for unemployment rates.
Test Steps:
Calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation for each sex and age group and validate against expected ranges.
Expected Result: Summary statistics should fall within reasonable and expected ranges.
These test cases would ensure that the structure, content, and consistency of the data frame meet the requirements for analysis. Each test case would require a specific implementation in R using functions like all(), any(), is.na(), duplicated(), and various logical checks.
