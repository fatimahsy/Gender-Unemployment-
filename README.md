# Analysing the Effect of Gender on Unemployment Between 2018-2023

## 📌 Overview

We examine data about unemployment rates for both male and female Canadians between the years of 2018-2023. Using multiple linear regression, we also create a multiple linear regression model to help us estimate the overall impacts of sex on unemployment rates within Gen Z.
